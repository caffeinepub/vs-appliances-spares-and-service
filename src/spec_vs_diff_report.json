  "summary": "REQ-31 and REQ-32 appear implemented by updating the header logo path in frontend/src/App.tsx and favicon links in frontend/index.html to the new v4 asset names. REQ-30 (actually adding the new generated PNG files under frontend/public/assets/generated) is not evidenced in the diff summary. The diff also introduces unrelated HTML behavior (Google site verification injection) that was not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-30",
      "requirement": "Generate new static transparent PNG logo assets that match the newly uploaded image (IMG_20260212_214859~4.png) exactly and save them under frontend/public/assets/generated using the .dim_WxH.png naming convention (including at least one horizontal logo and at least one square/favicon-sized logo).",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added/modified PNG files under frontend/public/assets/generated for the new v4 assets; only code references to v4 filenames are shown. The diff summary indicates 'Added: 0' files, and the visible asset listing references v3 assets, not v4.",
