  "summary": "The diff only modifies project_state.json (project metadata). No frontend code changes were made to replace service card icons with <img> tags, and no static image assets were added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Therefore, REQ-4 and REQ-5 are not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Services section uses static image assets (not icon components) for the AC, Washing Machine, Refrigerator, and Electrical service cards, and that each service card renders an <img> with an appropriate English alt text.",
      "reason": "No changes are shown to frontend/src/App.tsx (or any frontend files) to replace icon components with <img> tags or add alt text; only project_state.json was modified.",

        "project_state.json"

      "requirement": "Add the required static image files for the AC, Washing Machine, Refrigerator, and Electrical service cards under frontend/public/assets/generated using the exact filenames referenced by the frontend so they load from /assets/generated/ at runtime.",
      "reason": "No files were added in the diff (Added: 0). The required PNG assets are not present in the diff summary.",

      "reason": "These icon replacements are outside the stated request scope (which is specifically the four Services cards: AC, Washing Machine, Refrigerator, Electrical). The diff only shows these as existing_features metadata and does not show corresponding requested implementation changes.",
